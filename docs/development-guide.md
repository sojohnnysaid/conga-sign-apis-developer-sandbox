# Development Blueprint: Test-Driven Svelte & Express Conga Sign Sandbox

## Overview

This blueprint outlines a test-driven development (TDD) sandbox application built with Svelte (frontend) and Express (backend). It is inspired by the "Resend or Cancel a Transaction Using Conga Sign APIs" and "Integrate UI Pages Using Sign APIs" modules, focusing on implementing those features in a lightweight, local development app. The application will demonstrate how Conga Sign's API can be used to embed and manage eSignature transactions within a custom app.

The scope is deliberately constrained to the happy path â€“ assuming the API credentials work and focusing on core Conga Sign API features.

## Key User Flows

1. **Configuration & Authentication Flow**: Setup API credentials and generate tokens
2. **Viewing and Managing Transactions**: Resend or cancel transactions from admin dashboard
3. **End-User Simulation Flow**: Simulate the recipient's experience receiving and completing signature requests

## Major Components and Classes

### Frontend Components (Svelte UI)

- ConfigPage.svelte - Configuration UI for entering credentials and generating tokens
- AdminDashboard.svelte - Admin view for managing transactions (resend/cancel)
- EndUserSimulator.svelte - UI simulating a recipient's view of signature requests
- Additional components for navigation, modals, etc.

### Backend Components (Express API & Services)

- ConfigManager class - Manages configuration data (environment, credentials, tokens)
- CongaApiClient class - Handles direct communication with Conga Sign's REST API
- TransactionManager class - Manages the lifecycle of transactions
- Express Routes - RESTful API endpoints for the frontend

## State Management and Reset

All application state is stored in two JSON files:
- config.json - Stores credentials, environment selection, and auth tokens
- transactions.json - Stores transaction data and status

A reset mechanism allows clearing state to quickly return to a clean starting point.

## Technical Notes

- Built with Svelte (frontend) and Express (backend)
- Uses JSON files for storage instead of a database for simplicity
- Implements simulated signing experience instead of a full integration
- Follows test-driven development practices with unit and e2e tests
